TECH NOTES

	 1) On some machines scene might be causing some major glitches and graphical artifacts. 
	    To solve this issue : 
	    A) Disable static batching in Edit/ProjectSettings/OtherSettings/StaticBatching CheckBox => Unchecked
	    B) Also You can Try reimporting All Static FBX files. Assets/Sanctuary/EnvironmentModels/SanctuaryModels/ Select All Models, 
	    then right click and reimport.

	 2) Most Texture atlases are maximum size 4k .tif Files. You Can Optimize them just using unity Texture compression or Max size DropDown Menus.
	    From Top down View You will still get nice look with much less texture resolutions.

	 3) Modular Tiles Can be used Seamlessly just using unity vertex Snap tool. (Holding V Key on Keyboard and Moving objects with Move Tool).
